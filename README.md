# randombot
this is like only for a friend and i have to private this somewhere in the future idk
the bots old token is there but for security purposes i put a new one that u cant get :D

install the files above and put them in a new folder called "mimicbot" (or whatever name)

ok so basically this is a simple bot with about 4 commands, <ping, <beep, <what is (person you ping), and like the main one which is where u mention it

ALSO THIS IS MISSING A FEW FILES, JUST DOWNLOAD DISCORD.JS WITH NODE.JS IN THE FOLDER USING COMMAND PROMPT TO INSTALL IT IN MIMIC BOT FOLDER USING "npm install discord.js" IN THE COMMAND PROMPT (make sure its cd/PCNAME/downloads/the folder you named mimicbot) then run the bot with the command "node index.js"

TO RUN IT YOU NEED TO HAVE NODE.JS
go download that or something: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
dont touch anything but the txt file if u want it to WORK.
now bye :D
